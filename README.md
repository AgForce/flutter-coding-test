# flutter-coding-test

This is a coding challenge for Flutter candidates.

Please check out this Git project and share your screen with us. In the code, you will find some TODOs. We are interested in your ideas on how
to solve these tasks, and how to structure the project for good maintainability going forward. You are not required to 
finish implementing the tasks within the interview's time. We are more interested in having a constructive discussion
about how the tasks can be solved.
